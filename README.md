# CLA Onboarding Repo

Presto can only accept contributions under a CLA. We use the EasyCLA tool to ensure that all contributors have signed the appropriate documents.

This is a neutral repo where you can open a trivial PR and initiate the [EasyCLA signing process](https://github.com/prestodb/tsc/blob/master/CLA.md). Please note that you can use this repo to sign the documents in advance, or you can skip straight to opening a PR against a project. Either way you will be directed through the same signing process.

Once you have signed as an individual or been added to your company's approved contributors list you will not be prompted to sign the CLA again.

All PRs will be closed periodically.

To learn more about this process, [please visit the Presto TSC repository](https://github.com/prestodb/tsc/blob/master/CLA.md).
